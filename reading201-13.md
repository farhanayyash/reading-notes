# Cookies
##  can be used for persistent local storage of small amounts of data.

# What we really want is
- a lot of storage space
- on the client
- that persists beyond a page refresh
- and isn’t transmitted to the server

# HTML5 Storage
## Simply put, it’s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. Like cookies, this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you. Unlike cookies, this data is never transmitted to the remote web server
