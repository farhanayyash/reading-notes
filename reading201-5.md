#  Images
## There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.
## If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.

# Three Rules for Creating Images
- Save images in the right format
- Save images at the right size
- Use the correct resolution

## The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page.

(or "see-through") for the web
