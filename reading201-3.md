# Lists

- **Ordered lists (ol, li)** are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in an order or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
- **Unordered lists(ul, li)** are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
- **Definition lists(dl, dd, dt)** is made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

# Nested List 
## You can put a second list inside an <li> element to create a sublist 
or a nested list.

# Boxes
## At the beginning of this section on CSS, you saw how CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box. You can set several properties that affect the appearance of these boxes. In this chapter you will see how to: 
Controls :
- he dimensions of your boxes
- Create borders around boxes
- Set margins and padding for boxes
-  Show and hide boxes

## Box Dimensions : (width, height)
## Limiting Width (min-width, max-width)
## Limiting height(min-height, max-height)

# overflow 
## The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:
- hidden
- scroll


# Border, Margin & Padding
- border: Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.
- Margin: Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
-Padding: Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.

# border-width : 
## thin, medium, thick

# border-style : 
## solid, dotted,  dashed,  double, groove, ridge, inset, outset, hidden

# border-color:
## You can specify the color of a border using either RGB values, hex codes or CSS color names.

# Centering Content :
## If you want to center a box on the page (or center it inside the element that it sits in), you can set the left-margin and right-margin to auto

# display : 
## inline, block, inline-block, none

# visibility 
## hidden, visible

# border-image
##  The border-image property applies an image to the border of any box. It takes a background image and slices it into nine pieces. 

# box-shadow
## Horizontal offset, Vertical offset, Blur distance, Spread of shadow

# border-radius 
## CSS3 introduces the ability to create rounded corners on any box,


# ARRAYS
##  An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.

# CREATING AN ARRAY
## You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable

# VALUES IN ARRAYS 
##  Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

# If.. Else statements
## Here you can see that an if ... else statement allows you to provide two sets of code:
- one set if the condition evaluates to true
- another set if the condition is false

# SWITCH
## the purpose of the switch, a statement is to present the user with a different message depending on which level they are at.

## JavaScript can convert data types behind the scenes to complete an operation. This is known as type coercion. Due to type coercion, every value in JavaScript can be treated as if it were true or false; and
this has some interesting side effects.

# CHECKING EQUALITY & EXISTENCE
##  Because the presence of an object or array can be considered truthy, it is often used to check for the existence of an element within a page.

# SHORT CIRCUIT VALUES
## Logical operators are processed left to right. They short-circuit (stop) as soon as they have a result - but they return the value that stopped the processing (not necessarily true or false).

# Loops 
## Loops check a coindation if it returns true, a code block will run. and the condition will check again until it returns false  
- for
- while
- do while

## for loop uses a counter as condition

# KEY LOOP CONCEPTS
##  Here are three points to consider when you are working with loops. Each is illustrated in examples on the following three pages.
-  KEYWORDS:  break, continue
- LOOPS & ARRAYS
- PERFORMANCE ISSUES

# USING FOR LOOPS
## A for loop is often used to loop through the items in an array

# USING WHILE LOOPS
## This loop will continue to run for as long as the condition in the parentheses is true

# USING DO WHILE LOOPS
## The key difference between a while loop and a do-while loop is that the statements in the code block come before the condition. This means that those statements are run once whether or not the condition is met.
