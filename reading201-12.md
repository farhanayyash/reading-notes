#  Canvas API
## Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool

# Drawing a line chart
## To draw a line chart, the first thing we need to do is create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw our chart.

## If your renderings seem distorted, try specifying your width and height attributes explicitly in the <canvas> attributes, and not using CSS.
