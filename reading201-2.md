# Text 
## When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.

## Headings
###  <h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> <h5> <h6>

##Paragraphs
### <P>

## Bold & Italic
### <b> <i>

## Superscript & Subscript
### <sup> <sub>

## Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules 
### <br/> <hr/>

# Semantic Markup
## There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages â€” they are known as semantic markup

## Strong & Emphasis
### <strong> <em>

## Quotations
### <blockquote> <q>

## Abbreviations & Acronyms
### <abbr> 

## Citations & Definitions
### <cite> <dfn>

## Auth or Details
### <address>

# Introducing CSS

## CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.

## Understanding CSS:
### The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.

CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

## Selector {declaration}

# How to add CSS to HTML:
## Using External CSS
###  <link>
## Using Internal CSS
### <style>

# Inheritance
## If you specify the font-family or color properties on the <body> element, they will apply to most child elements. This is because the value of the font-family property is inherited by child elements. It saves you from having to apply these properties to as many elements (and results in simpler style sheets).

## Different versions of CSS & Browser Quirks
### CSS1 was released in 1996 and CSS2 followed two years later. Work on CSS3 has been ongoing but the major browsers have already started to implement it.

## Basic Javascript instruction 
### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.

## COMMENTS  
### You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.
- MULTI-LINE COMMENTS /*
- SINGLE-LINE COMMENTS //

# VARIABLE
### A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables. A variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs.

## define variable :
### variable key (var) variable name(quantity)
## assign value to variable :
### var name = var value 

# DATA TYPES
### JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans.
1. NUMERIC DATA TYPE
2. STRING DATA TYPE
3. BOOLEAN DATA TYPE

## RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES :
1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.
2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
3.  You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. For example, var is a keyword used to declare a variable. Reserved words are ones that may be used in a future version of JavaScript.
4. All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.
5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the
variable stores. For example, fi rstName might be used to store a person's first name, l astNarne for their last name, and age for their age.
6. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. For example, f i rstName rather than fi rstnarne (this is referred to as camel case). You can also use an underscore between each word (you cannot use a dash).

# ARRAYS
## An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values

# CREATING AN ARRAY 
## colors= ['white', 'black', 'custom'];

# VALUES IN ARRAYS 
## Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

# EXPRESSIONS
## An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking

## there are two types of expressions :
* EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
*EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE-VALUE.

# OPERATORS
## Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
*  ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS (=)
* COMPARISON OPERATORS (< , >, ==)
* ARITHMETIC OPERATORS(- , * , / ,  +)
* LOGICAL OPERATORS(and, or, nor)
* STRING OPERATORS ( + )

# EVALUATIONS
## You can analyze values in your scripts to determine whether or note they match expected results.

# DECISIONS
## Using the results of evaluations, you can decide which path your script should go down.

# LOOPS
## There are also many occasions where you will want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly.

# USING COMPARISON OPERATORS
## At the most basic level, you can evaluate two variables using a comparison operator to return a true or false value.

## LOGICAL AND
## LOGICAL OR 
## LOGICAL Not 
## IF STATEMENTS
## IF ... ELSE STATEMENTS
