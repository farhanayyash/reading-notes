# Practical Information
## Search Engine Optimization (SEO) SEO is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers. 

## SEO is often split into two areas:
- On-page techniques: These are the methods you can use on your web pages to improve their rating in search engines. The main component of this is looking at keywords that people are likely to enter into a search engine
- Getting other sites to link to you is just as important as on-page techniques. Search engines help determine how to rank your site by looking at the number of other sites that link to yours. They are particularly interested in sites whose content is related to yours. Analytics You need to know how people are coming to your website, the number of visitors, what the users are looking at.

### Hosting and sending data to your website To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting. FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server. Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce, and other popular website tools (to save you writing them from scratch).
