# Introducing CSS

## CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.

## Understanding CSS:
### The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.

CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

## Selector {declaration}

# How to add CSS to HTML:
## Using External CSS
###  <link>
## Using Internal CSS
### <style>

# Inheritance
## If you specify the font-family or color properties on the <body> element, they will apply to most child elements. This is because the value of the font-family property is inherited by child elements. It saves you from having to apply these properties to as many elements (and results in simpler style sheets).

## Different versions of CSS & Browser Quirks
### CSS1 was released in 1996 and CSS2 followed two years later. Work on CSS3 has been ongoing but the major browsers have already started to implement it.


# Color
## Color can really bring your pages to life. Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue.

### The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
* RGB values : RGB(102,205,170)
* hex codes : #66cdaa
* color names: MediumAquaMarine

## background-color 
### CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.
 
## find the color you want
### you can use a color picker.

# Contrast
## When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.
*  Low Contrast
*  High Contrast
* Medium Contrast

# Opacity 
## CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).

# HSL Colors
## CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values.
* hue
* saturation
* lightness
