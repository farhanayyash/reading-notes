# WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
## Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

## IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES
##  IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS

# Creating an object: Literal Notion
## literal notion is the easiest and most popular way to create objects
## var name = {properties, methods };

# Accessing an object and dot notation
##  you access the properties or methods using dot notation 
### var object-name = name.properties

# Document Object Model (DOM)
## The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

# THE DOM TREE IS A MODEL OF A WEB PAGE
## As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page.
The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory. It consists of four main types of nodes.
- THE DOCUMENT NODE
- ELEMENT NODES
- ATTRIBUTE NODES
- TEXT NODES

# WORKING WITH THE DOM TREE
- Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.
- Use its text content, child elements, and attributes.

# caching dom queries
## GetElementById("one");

# ACCESSING ELEMENTS
## DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist, which is a collection of nodes.

# NODELISTS: DOM QUERIES THAT RETURN MORE THAN ONE ELEMENT
## When a DOM method can return more than one element, it returns a Nodelist (even if it only finds one matching element).

# SELECTING ELEMENTS BY TAG NAME
## getElementByTagName();

# SELECTING ELEMENTS USING CSS SELECTORS
## querySelector()

# TRAVERSING THE DOM
## When you have an element node, you can select another element in relation to it using these five properties. This is known as traversing the DOM.

# WHITESPACE NODES
## Traversing the DOM can be difficult because some browsers add a text node whenever they come across whitespace between elements.

# Fl RST & LAST CHILD
- startltem.firstChild;
- startitem.lastChild;

# ACCESS & UPDATE A TEXT NODE WITH NODEVALUE
## When you select a text node, you can retrieve or amend the content of it using the node Value property.

# ACCESS & UPDATE TEXT WITH TEXTCONTENT (& INN ERTEXT)
## The textContent property allows you to collect or update just the text that is in the containing element (and its children).

# ACCESS & UPDATE TEXT & MARKUP WITH INNERHTML
## Using the innerHTML property, you can access and amend the contents of an element, including any child elements.

# ADDING ELEMENTS USING DOM MANIPULATION
## DOM manipulation offers another technique to add new content to a page (rather than innerHTML).
- createElement ()
- createTextNode()
- appendChild()

# REMOVING ELEMENTS VIA DOM MANIPULATION
## DOM manipulation can be used to remove elements from the DOM tree.


# COMPARING TECHNIQUES: UPDATING HTML CONTENT
## So far, you have seen three techniques for adding HTML to a web page. It's time to compare when you should use each one.

# CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (XSS) ATTACKS
## If you add HTML to a page using innerHTML (or several jQuery methods), you need to be aware of Cross-Site Scripting Attacks or XSS; otherwise, an attacker could gain access to your users' accounts.

# XSS: ESCAPING & CONTROLLING MARKUP
## Any content generated by users that contain characters that are used in code should be escaped on the server. You must control any markup added to the page.

# EXAMINING THE DOM IN CHROME
## Modern browsers come with tools that help you inspect the page loaded in the browser and understand the structure of the DOM tree.
